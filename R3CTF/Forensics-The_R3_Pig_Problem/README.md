# The R3 Pig Problem (Forensics)

## Description
R3GIRL opened the resulting text, for the first time, a human being read a message from the r3kapig world. There was a warning repeated three times:

"Do not answer! Do not answer!! Do not answer!!!"

The message revealed a huge secret, and the fate of the entire human race was now tied to her fingers!

## Solution

Recovered a hidden flag from a pcap file using TCP timestamp deltas as a covert timing channel. Applied thresholding and bit-shifting to reconstruct the message.
